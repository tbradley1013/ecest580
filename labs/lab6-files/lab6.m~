% to strip these when importing the sequence into Matlab, hint: fastaread).

% The plot created above is fairly similar to the one created using the
% online tool. Bases 3, 4, 5 and 16, 17, 18 are the highest groupings 
% of R values in both of the plots. The e(n) value in the online tool 
% (set to zero here) likely corrects for potential bias that may be
% introduced when only a small amount of data is used to determine the
% entropy in a sequence alignment.
